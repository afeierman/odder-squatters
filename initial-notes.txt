Deadline of this weekend to clean (2/26)  and visualize the data

Thoughts about each variable:

bathrooms: number of bathrooms 
#there will probably be a peak around 1 or 2 bathrooms, and this will probably be a key field

bedrooms: number of bathrooms
#similar to bathrooms, there will be a peak around 1 to 3 bedrooms, as most renters will look for those types of apartments, this will be a key field

building_id
#unclear, unless that links to when an apartment is posted

created
#apartments created during popular periods (weekends, after work) might get more views

description
#scan for keywords that people will search for
#this might require some NLP

display_address
#perhaps popular streets, like 'broadway', will improve interest. 
#street can indicate neighborhood
#see if we can find some key words in address that draw interest
#break it down into number, street name, and street suffix? TBD

features: a list of features about this apartment
#also NLP, also very important
#we need to do a transformation on this, to perhaps break features into different categories or columns

latitude
#not sure if it'll be important, but use it

listing_id
#not clear if useful

longitude
#not sure if it'll be important, but use it

manager_id
#could be a proxy for good pictures, leave it but use it


photos: a list of photo links. You are welcome to download the pictures yourselves from renthop's site, but they are the same as imgs.zip. 
#deal with it later

price: in USD
#there will be a peak in interest around 25% of a standard household income?

street_address
#not clear how this is different from display address. we'll figure it out later

interest_level: this is the target variable. It has 3 categories: 'high', 'medium', 'low'
